## This is a SwiftUI iOS app that was built with TDD.

### 🔍 More
- I've taken a tvOS UIKit tutorial from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/110/build-a-unit-converter-for-tvos) as a starting point.
- This app can convert distance, duration, mass, temperature or volume units.
